# Delphi Inside


Introducing the WALTER Framework: **W**orkable **A**lgorithms for **L**ocation-aware **T**ransmission, **E**ncryption **R**esponse. Designed for modern developers, WALTER is a groundbreaking suite of NuGet packages crafted for excellence in .NET Standard 2.0, 2.1, Core 3.1, and .NET 6, 7, 8, and Pascall and C++ environments. By integrating Delphi's native development strengths, we’ve enhanced WALTER’s encryption capabilities to be robust and future-proof, ensuring that it excels in performance, stability, and cross-platform support.

Whether you're tackling networking, encryption, or secure communication, WALTER offers unparalleled efficiency and precision in processing, making it an essential tool for developers prioritizing speed, security, and memory management in their applications.


In the evolving landscape of software development, the need for applications that are both robust and capable of withstanding the test of time is paramount. As we continuously strive to enhance the WALTER framework's capabilities, our journey led us to a pivotal decision: transitioning to Delphi for handling native calls. This decision was not made lightly but was informed by Delphi's unparalleled strength in areas where .NET, despite its vast ecosystem, falls short, particularly in Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation and the support for long-term stability operations.

## Why Delphi?

Delphi stands out as a leading development platform that inherently supports AoT compilation, allowing for the creation of platform-specific binaries without compromising quality or functionality. Unlike .NET, which offers limited AoT capabilities and lacks comprehensive support for certain critical features necessary for long-term stability, Delphi immediately ensures that every compiled application is optimized for the target platform. This optimization includes performance enhancements and increased reliability over extended periods, which is crucial for applications requiring decade-long operational lifecycles.

## Enhanced Security with Delphi

### Addressing Free-After-Use Vulnerabilities
One of the decisive factors in our pivot to Delphi is the handling of Free-After-Use vulnerabilities—a critical security concern that remains inadequately addressed in the .NET ecosystem. Despite the advantages of .NET's garbage collector in managing memory, it falls short in mitigating Free-After-Use exploits. These vulnerabilities occur when an application continues to use memory after it has been freed, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. Microsoft's stance on not fully addressing this issue within the garbage collector's scope has necessitated a move to a platform where memory management can be more tightly controlled. Delphi's explicit memory management model allows developers to proactively prevent Free-After-Use scenarios, offering a more secure foundation for critical software development.

### Enhancing Buffer Overflow Protection

Moreover, the transition to Delphi significantly bolsters our defenses against buffer overflow attacks, especially in the sensitive area of .NET's interaction with Windows header files. While .NET provides a managed environment that abstracts many low-level operations, direct interactions with the OS through P/Invoke and similar mechanisms expose applications to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are unacceptable because they can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, and other security breaches. Delphi's rigorous compile-time and runtime checks, combined with its more granular control over memory allocation and data handling, significantly mitigate the risk of buffer overflows. This heightened level of security is critical when our native calls interface with the underlying Windows OS, ensuring that data integrity and application stability are maintained.


## Recognized Memory Safety

Delphi's commitment to security and stability is further validated by its inclusion in the Department of Defense's (DoD) list of Memory Safe Languages. This acknowledgment highlights Delphi's robustness in managing memory safely and efficiently, a critical component in preventing vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of software applications. The DoD's recognition underscores the strategic advantage of choosing Delphi for the development of applications where memory safety is paramount. For more information on Delphi's designation as a memory-safe language, refer to the DoD's guidelines on Software Memory Safety: https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF.


### Unmatched AoT Support

Delphi's architecture is the epitome of AoT philosophy, designed from the ground up to generate native code for each platform it supports. This approach eliminates the need for a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation at runtime, thereby reducing startup times and improving overall application performance. For WALTER, leveraging Delphi means that our native calls are executed more efficiently, with a direct path to the hardware capabilities of each operating system, whether it be Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, or Android.

### Ensuring Long-term Stability

The adoption of Delphi is also a strategic move to future-proof the WALTER framework. In an era where software needs to operate beyond the immediate technology cycles, Delphi's commitment to backward compatibility and its focus on stability ensure that applications built today remain functional and secure in the future. This is particularly important for critical systems where updates may not be feasible or where legacy support is essential.

### Bridging the Feature Gap

By integrating Delphi for native operations, we bridge the gap left by .NET in areas such as detailed memory management, real-time performance optimizations, and full control over hardware interactions. Delphi's rich set of features and its comprehensive library support mean that WALTER can offer more to developers: more control, more performance, and more stability, without the overhead of managing complex cross-platform compatibility issues.

## Conclusion

The switch to Delphi for native calls within the WALTER framework marks a significant step towards achieving our goal of providing a robust, efficient, and future-proof suite of tools for developers. By embracing Delphi's superior AoT compilation and its focus on long-term application stability, we ensure that WALTER remains at the forefront of technology, ready to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.

In essence, Delphi is not just a tool in our arsenal; it is a cornerstone of our commitment to quality and functionality, enabling us to deliver a level of performance and reliability that truly sets WALTER apart in the world of software development.
